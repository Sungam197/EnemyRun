For this to work you need to have pygame installed. you can see how to install pygame by looking up a tutorial on youtube.
if you already have python, open up the terminal, (or vscode terminal if you are using vscode) and run the command: pip install pygame.
then run the code in python or in a text editor like vscode.


just a random game i made, first python game for me aswell

/// If you want to resize the window, the height and width are on line 6 and 7 \\\

  ^^^this is helpful because python window sizing is set to pixels, so a lower resolution screen will make the window bigger, because there are less pixels.
    think of it as a grid. and each square is a pixel. the grid is always in the same size frame. picture you are a 5x5 square in the grid. if the grid is 100x100, you look pretty small. but if the grid is a 6x6 grid, then you are bigger because there is less space for you to move around. sorry for the lesson. but mabye this is helpful for less experienced people.


  CYA :D
