For this to work you need to have pygame installed. you can see how to install pygame by looking up a tutorial on youtube.
if you already have python, open up the terminal, (or vscode terminal if you are using vscode) and run the command: pip install pygame.
then run the code in python or in a text editor like vscode.


just a random game i made, first python game for me aswell
